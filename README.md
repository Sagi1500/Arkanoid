## About
I implemented a version of the Arkanoid game as part of the OOP course I took during my bachelor's degree.</br>
The game contains various levels with increasing difficulty in a GUI-friendly platform.</br>
I implemented the game with Java language using Intellij IDEA Ultimate IDE, using the following OOP principles:
* Polymorphism and inheritance.
* Usage basic design patterns in OOP, such as Observer, Builder, etc.
* Usage several generic collections and data structures such as linked lists and ArrayList.
* Working with GUI.

## Dependencies
* Windows / Linux / macOS
* Git
* Keyboard that contains: Spacebar (for stoppage), "P" button, and all arrows.
* Apache Ant
